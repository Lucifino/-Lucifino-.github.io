	<h3> Favorite CMSC subject </h3>
	<p>
	I am currently taking CMSC 123 under Mr. Arian Jacildo. it is by far the most interesting subject I have taken. Other than correcting my inferior code, 123 is teaching me data structures. I can only imagine the possbilities I can do withsuch knowledge. All in all it can be broken down to two things,
	I enjoy the professor's way of teaching and the subject matter itself.

	<h3> Favorite Food </h3>
	<p>
	Any dish that chicken or fish is the hero in it, is a favorite in my book. Chicken and fish are good sources of protein. They are lean and clean, unlike pork. While beef is a good protein, it is not processed by the body well enough unlike chicken or fish. I need good protein after I lift weights, otherwise my muscles will not repair itself effiecently.

	<h3> About Me </h3>
	<p>
	I am a UPLB BS Computer Science undergraduate. I currently stay in Banue St., Navarro, although I go home to Quezon City from time to time. For the past several months I have been into body building. I currently do monthly sessions in Alexis, and am somewhat strict with my diet. I am also a social drinker. I get along with just about anybody, as long as there is beer. I am also currently an active resident member of the UPLB Computer Science Society. I am also a bit of a geek.

	<h3> Expectations </h3>
	<p>
	Frankly, I am weakest when doing web programming. Hopefully this class can help me become competent, even if it is just by a bit. I really want to be just done with this.
