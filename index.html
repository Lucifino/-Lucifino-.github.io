	<h3> Favorite CMSC subject </h3>

	<h3> Favorite Food </h3>
	<p>
	Any dish that chicken or fish is the hero in it, is a favorite in my book. Chicken and fish are good sources of protein. They are lean and clean, unlike pork. While beef is a good protein, it is not processed by the body well enough unlike chicken or fish. I need good protein after I lift weights, otherwise my muscles will not repair itself effiecently.
